# üè† Smart Home Entry System

## üéØ Project Goal
Design a simple smart home access control system that allows entry using a password. The system is activated by a motion sensor, unlocks the door using a motor (DC/Servo) upon valid password entry, and supports communication via UART, SPI, or I2C.

**Note:** This project does **not** use EEPROM for password storage ‚Äî all data is handled in RAM.

## üìö Educational Concepts Covered

- Embedded System Components (Processor, Memory, Buses, Clock)
- Microcontroller internals (Registers, Stack Pointer, Program Counter)
- Memory types: Flash, SRAM
- Sensor interfacing (PIR/IR)
- Motor control (DC or Servo)
- Communication Protocols (UART / SPI / I2C)
- Keypad input handling
- LCD display interfacing
- Layered software architecture: 
  - **MCAL** (Hardware drivers)
  - **HAL** (Logic abstraction)
  - **APP** (Application logic)

## üß† System Workflow

1. Motion is detected by IR or PIR sensor.
2. The system wakes up and displays "Enter Password" on the LCD.
3. User enters a password using the Keypad.
4. If password is correct:
   - LCD shows "Access Granted"
   - Door opens via Motor (DC or Servo)
   - Communication protocol (UART/SPI/I2C) sends log message
5. If password is incorrect:
   - LCD shows "Access Denied"
   - Red LED turns on
6. After 3 failed attempts:
   - System locks for a short delay (stored in RAM)
7. Admin button allows system reset or override access.
