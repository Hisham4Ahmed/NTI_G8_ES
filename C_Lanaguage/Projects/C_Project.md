# Library Management System  (Terminal-based)

# Project Brief

A client owns a small physical library and requested a simple command-line program to help manage the collection of books. This system should allow adding, viewing, deleting, searching, and updating the availability status of books.

The program will run in the terminal and does **not** require a graphical interface. The system should be built using C language concepts covered during the course.
